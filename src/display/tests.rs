// NOTE: Unit tests removed as they require std library features (Vec, String, format!)
// that are not available in this no_std environment.
// Integration tests should be used instead for testing this functionality.
//
// The display module functionality can be tested through integration tests
// in the `tests/` directory, which have access to std features.
